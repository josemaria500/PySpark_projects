# NASA Wildfire Data Processing with PySpark 🔥

This project uses **PySpark** to process and analyze NASA's global wildfire datasets.  
It focuses on large-scale data ingestion, transformation, and analysis using distributed computing techniques.

## 🌍 Overview

Wildfires represent a major global challenge, affecting ecosystems, air quality, and human safety.  
NASA’s **FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)** provides open-access satellite data for active fires and thermal anomalies.

This project demonstrates how to:
- Ingest and clean large wildfire datasets with **PySpark**.
- Perform distributed transformations and aggregations.
- Analyze spatial and temporal fire patterns.
- Export results to Parquet/CSV for downstream analytics or visualization.
